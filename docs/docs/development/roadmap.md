## For LLM Analysis

This roadmap is structured for both human readers and LLMs:

### Document Structure
- Features are tagged with unique identifiers
- Clear hierarchy of priorities
- Explicit dependencies noted
- Timeline indicators

### Feature Tags
- **[CORE-*]**: Core functionality
- **[BUILD-*]**: Build system
- **[DEV-*]**: Developer experience
- **[DIST-*]**: Distribution
- **[TOOLS-*]**: Development tools
- **[CI-*]**: CI/CD features

### Priority Mapping
```python
priorities = {
    "P0": "Critical",
    "P1": "High",
    "P2": "Medium",
    "P3": "Low"
}
```

### Version Mapping
```python
versions = {
    "v1.x": "Current Focus",
    "v2.x": "Near-Term",
    "v3.x": "Long-Term"
}
```

When analyzing this roadmap:
1. Consider feature dependencies
2. Note priority levels
